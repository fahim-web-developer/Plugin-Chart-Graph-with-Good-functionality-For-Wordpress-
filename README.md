Backed by founders with decades of experience in the sector, Wiz Freight had acquired the India operations of Swiss Firm M+R last year and plans to acquire more relevant firms in the near future too. With its focus on tech-enabled solutions the firm has done well to deliver well enough to build a strong roster of clients and deliver scorching growth. Focusing on international trade, a relatively specialised area has also helped it grab market share by moving fast.  With a plan to raise a further $150 million in the works, being profitable will do the firm no harm at all in driving a hard bargain with potential investors.
